- 👋 Hi, I’m @SEM7AC I am a retired Army veteran who spent all of my time in aviation maintenance
-     and at the age of 40 I am now looking to change my career into software developement. I
-     started young writing simple programs in QBASIC and then later C/C++. Picking back up I have
-     added C# to the list and have been amazed how modern IDE's help programmers write code.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in C/C++/C# and any projects that are related to the aviation field. If
-     I could combine both fields that would be a dream job. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software Developement @WGU and I am about half way through my BS. I also
-     am thinking about exploring Java as the school offers a C# or Java track but have way more experince
-     with C#. All that being said I expect to learn how software problems are solved in the real world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner level projects as I am just getting started with Git Hub
- 📫 How to reach me ... I will figure this out later...
